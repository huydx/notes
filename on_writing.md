# On writing

Good references on how to be a better writer

- How to Write More Clearly, Think More Clearly, and Learn Complex Material More Easily: http://www.covingtoninnovations.com/mc/WriteThinkLearn.pdf 
 

Important ideas:

- Five steps to write: Planning (audience, how to write) -> Drafting -> Revising -> Editing -> Formatting  
- A Nice trick to start planning: write down ideas in random order, then sort them
- Another nice trick: write introduction last, after we know what it will introduce
- 3 rules for clear drafting: repeat(get to the point) (or could be rephrased as: state the main point before you give the reasoning that leads to it)
- When revising, pretend to be your own worst enemy, who always try to nitpick on what they mis-understand
- Learn to remove words, not to add words (cut out words that are not necessary)
- Clear understanding leads to clear writing (learn how to understand things "clearly" is important)
- Good trick for clear understanding: if you guess anything, must test your guess immediately. Also our education system "encourages unclear understanding"
- To learn complex material easily: have goals + adjust oftenly, use "suitable" strategy, insist on clear understanding, organize the knowledge
- Organize knowledge: make your own notes, "Pretend you're writing a textbook"
- The goal is to "build a structure in your own mind", not to "absorb something that somebody else gives you"
